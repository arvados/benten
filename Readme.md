# Benten
_(This software is in the very early stages of development)_

This is a workflow helper for [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/) documents.

Many advanced CWL users are comfortable creating tools and workflows "by hand"
using a plain text editor. When creating complex enough workflows there are some 
activities that can get tedious, repetitive and error prone when done manually. 
_Benten_ is a GUI that automates and simplifies some of these tasks. 

_Benten_ is written using Python and [Pyside2] (QT for Python)
