# Benten (pre-alpha) 

This is a [language server] for [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/) documents.

<img align="right" height="150px" src="media/benten-icon.png"></img>
Many advanced CWL users are comfortable creating tools and workflows "by hand"
using a plain text editor. When creating complex enough workflows navigating 
and editing the resultant document and sub-documents can get tedious. Keeping
track of the bigger picture (what components have been added, what connections
have been set) can also get hard. 

_Benten_ is a language server that offers help with code snippets, 
navigation and syntax checking of CWL documents.

_Benten_ is written using Python3 and developed against VS Code. The language
server component will work with any editor/IDE that offers language server
support. Syntax highlighting is currently only available for the VS Code
extension. The VS Code extension is written in Typescript.

# Server installation

Benten requires [Python 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you will be installing from source you will need
[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your system

A neat way to install `benten` in a virtual env (isolating it from your
system python) and still be able to call it as a regular executable is
to use `pipx`

```
pip3 install pipx  # in case you don't have pipx
pipx install --spec git+https://github.com/rabix/benten.git benten
```

_Note: `pipx` installs the executables in `$HOME/.local/bin`
(`%HOMEPATH%\.local\bin` for Windows). This needs to be added to your
PATH env variable_

To install from develop branch (or some other branch): 
```
pipx install --spec git+https://github.com/rabix/benten.git@develop benten
```

Or, if you have cloned the repository and want to play with the server
code itself:

```
pipx install -e benten
```


# Install VS Code extension

- Download the VS Code extension file (.vsix) from the releases page
- In the extensions pane on VS Code use "Install from VSIX..." to install this .vsix file

# Using with VI/Vim

See [this page](docs/vim.md) please.


# Tips and Tricks

Benten attaches onto your regular text editor and offers help by
way of auto-completions and document validations, so most of its
functionality is exposed naturally via the editor's regular UI, and a 
specialized tutorial is not necessary, but some helpful 
[tips and tricks](docs/tips.md) are listed in this page.

The low level client-server communication [code][jsonrpc-code] is taken from [Sourcegraph's
(now defunct) Python Language Server][sourcegraph-python] as is the VS Code client code (which
was based originally off Microsoft's example code). The CWL preview uses [vis.js]

# What's in a name? 

**Saraswati** is the Hindu goddess of learning and knowledge and a long time ago 
she visited Japan, where she is known as [Benzaiten] (**Benten** for short) and 
her sitar has morphed into a Japanese _biwa_ but she has kept some of her many arms.

Benzaiten is the goddess of everything that flows: water, time, words, speech, 
eloquence, music and by extension, knowledge. Therefore _Benten_ is an 
appropriate goddess for scientific workflow developers.
